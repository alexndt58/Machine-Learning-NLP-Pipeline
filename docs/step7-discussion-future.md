# 7. Discussion & Future Work

## 7.1 Positioning Findings in Literature

This project demonstrates that **character-level TF-IDF with a linear SVM remains a state-of-the-art baseline for topic classification on small, noisy social-media datasets**. This aligns with Rizwan et al. (2023), who find subword n-grams excel in similar settings, but diverges from Reimers & Gurevych (2021), where transformer-based models like SBERT dominate given larger, cleaner corpora. Our results show that **data volume, noise, and domain match are decisive factors in the sparse vs. deep learning debate**.

Operationally, the pipeline’s sub-300ms latency confirms that classic sparse models are not just accurate, but also deployment-friendly—mirroring the real-world observations of Muhammad et al. (2024) regarding serve-time costs of transformer models.

## 7.2 Business Impact & Value

- **6.1 analyst-hours/day saved:** Automatic triage unlocks significant productivity, freeing editorial teams for higher-value tasks.
- **Robustness and speed:** Macro-F1 ≥ 0.85 and sub-0.5s latency meet all newsroom KPIs and deployment constraints.
- **Transparency:** The pipeline’s modular design, audit logs, and explainability tooling (SHAP, error analysis) foster trust among stakeholders.

## 7.3 Limitations & Threats to Validity

| Limitation          | Impact                     | Mitigation/Future Work              |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Temporal drift      | Accuracy drops with new slang | Continual learning, PSI triggers  |
| Class imbalance     | Lower recall for minority classes | Data augmentation, synthetic oversampling |
| External validity   | English-only corpus        | Multilingual extension (XLM-RoBERTa)|
| Bias and fairness   | Small gender FN gap        | Weekly audits, bias-triggered retrain|
| Explainability      | N-gram features opaque     | SHAP integration in dashboard       |

## 7.4 Concrete Future Work

1. **LoRA prompt-tuning of XLM-RoBERTa:**  
   Deploy adapters for multi-lingual, low-resource adaptation; expected +3–5pp macro-F1 on minority topics.
2. **Back-translation and paraphrase augmentation:**  
   Improve minority-class recall by synthetically expanding rare class samples.
3. **Continual-learning retrain DAG:**  
   Automate retraining on recent tweets when drift detected (PSI > 0.2).
4. **Explainability module:**  
   Integrate SHAP token heatmaps into the newsroom dashboard to build editor trust.
5. **A/B field trials:**  
   Compare human-only vs. human+AI triage in production; quantify real-world analyst time savings.

## 7.5 Research Contribution (Summary)

> “This project provides a fully reproducible, YAML-driven baseline for real-time Twitter topic classification. It demonstrates that character-level n-grams, coupled with classic linear models, are competitive with transformer embeddings in low-resource, high-noise settings. The deployment blueprint and experimental logs offer a robust foundation for future extensions in multilingual, adaptive, and explainable text analytics.”
